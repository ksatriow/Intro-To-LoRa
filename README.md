# Intro To LoRa
This repository provide practical documentation using LoRa integrated with all Microcontroller

This project allows you to practice LoRa for all **Microcontroller**. It can be used as an alternative to `Premium Course` and offers useful features and customization using sensor.

It has been written **100% in C**. ❤️

# Protocol
IoT communication protocols are modes of communication that protect and ensure optimum security to the data being exchanged between connected devices. The IoT devices are typically connected to the Internet via an IP (Internet Protocol) network. (https://www.kelltontech.com/kellton-tech-blog/internet-of-things-protocols-standards)

## LoRa
LoRa is a wireless modulation technique derived from Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) technology. It encodes information on radio waves using chirp pulses - similar to the way dolphins and bats communicate! LoRa modulated transmission is robust against disturbances and can be received across great distances. LoRaWAN is a media access control (MAC) protocol for wide area networks. It is designed to allow low-powered devices to communicate with Internet-connected applications over long range wireless connections. (https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/what-is-lorawan/)

# Contribution

I highly encourage the community to step forward and improve this library further. You can fix any reported bug, propose or implement new features, write tests, etc.

Here is a quick list of things to remember -
* Check the open issues before creating a new one,
* Help me in reducing the number of open issues by fixing any existing bugs,
* Check the roadmap to see if you can help in implementing any new feature,
* You can contribute by writing unit and integration tests for this library,
* If you have any new idea that aligns with the goal of this library, feel free to raise a feature request and discuss it.
